# Hangman

> A Hangman Game that asks the user for a letter and checks if it is in the word. It starts with a default number of lives and a random word from the word_list.


## Milestone 1

Coded a method, ask_letter, of the Hangman class that iteratively asks a user to enter a single character.

## Milestone 2

Completed a check letter method, which traverses the random word, replaces letter in the word_guessed until it is fullly revealed. User wins if the
if the word is completely guessed, or if the user runs out of lives before then
